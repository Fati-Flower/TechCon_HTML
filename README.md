# My First Portfolio

This project contains basic HTML exercises to help me understand the structure of an HTML page and practice creating valid web pages.

## File: `base_index.html`

This is a simple and valid HTML5 file. It includes:

- A proper `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- A `<head>` section with a title and metadata
- An empty `<body>` for future content

The file has been tested using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and passes with no errors.

## Objective

To build the foundation of my personal portfolio using correct and accessible HTML practices.
